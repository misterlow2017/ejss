      Free Body Diagrams
    </h1>
    <p>
      The free body diagram helps you understand and solve static and dynamic 
      problem involving forces. It is a diagram including all forces acting on 
      a given object without the other object in the system. You need to first 
      understand all the forces acting on the object and then represent these 
      force by arrows in the direction of the force to be drawn.

      The Highlight Approach to Draw Free Body Diagram
    </h1>
    <p>
      The main goal of using the highlight approach is to make sure that 
      students can account for all the contact forces. In order for contact 
      forces to exist, there must be a physical contact. This naturally led us 
      to talk about forces in terms of contact forces and noncontact forces as 
      we started to draw the FBDs.

      Case Study
    </h1>
    <p>
      Two blocks, block A and block B, are placed on a frictionless table in 
      contact with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hand applies a horizontal force on block A to the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steps taken to produce two separate FBDs: one for block A and 
      another for block B are described
