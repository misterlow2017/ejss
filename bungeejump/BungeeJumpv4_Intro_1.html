      Bungee Jumping is a thrill seekers adventure that also allows for an 
      investigation of energy concepts including Kinetic Energy, Gravitational 
      Potential Energy and Elastic Potential Energy. Gravitational Energy 
      (determined by height above the ground) is converted into Kinetic Energy 
      until the slackness in the bungee cord is taken up. When the jumper 
      reaches the end of his rope, there is an interplay between the three 
      types of energy until Kinetic Energy reaches zero .

      In this simulation, a bungee jumper is dropped from a tower with a fixed 
      length of bungee cord. The simulation operator can control the height of 
      the tower, the stiffness of the bungee cord (determined by its spring 
      constant k), the unstretched length of the bungee cord and the jumper's 
      mass. The player buttons are the play/pause button, the rewind (to t=0) 
      button and the reset button (resets all parameters to initial values). 
      The operator may optionally display the forces acting on the jumper and 
      a plot of the g-forces versus time. Note that the simulation measures 
      the altitude in terms of the location of his feet, thus he hits the 
      ground if his feet get within his 1.7m of height to the ground.
