      <u>How to use the simulation</u>
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Start by setting the platform height to its minimum (h=10m), the spring 
      constant of the bungee cord to its stiffest setting (k=200 N/m), the 
      length of the bungee cord to its minimum (Lo=5m) and the jumper's mass 
      to its minimum (m=40kg). Through trial and error determine the minimum 
      platform height needed for a &quot;safe&quot; jump.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Play the simulation with these safe jump settings and watch the 
        interplay between the various types of energy. Does the total energy 
        change?
      </li>
      <li>
        Are the g-forces experienced by the jumper reasonable, dangerous or 
        even fatal?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      With our &quot;safe&quot; jump settings above, consider the effect of the 
      following on the saftey of the jump:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        increasing/decreasing the jumper's mass,
      </li>
      <li>
        increasing/decreasing the unstretched length of the cord,
      </li>
      <li>
        increasing/decreasing the stretchiness of the bungee cord (by 
        decreasing/increasing k)
      </li>
      <li>
        What kind of changes do you think the jump operator should make in 
        order to accomodate a heavier jumper after a succesful jump by a 
        lighter jumper?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For a 40 kg jumper and a 30 m platform height and a &quot;safe&quot; jump,
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        determine the longest (Lo) bungee cord that can be used for the 
        stiffest bungee cord (k=200N/m)
      </li>
      <li>
        for the shortest bungee cord (Lo=5m) determine the least stiff 
        springiness (smallest k)
      </li>
      <li>
        compare these two ride experiences from the jumper's perspective (look 
        at g-force!)
      </li>
    </ul>
