      The momentum of an isolated system is a constant. The vector sum of the 
      momenta mv of all the objects of a system cannot be changed by 
      interactions within the system. This puts a strong constraint on the 
      types of motions which can occur in an isolated system. If one part of 
      the system is given a momentum in a given direction, then some other 
      part or parts of the system must simultaneously be given exactly the 
      same momentum in the opposite direction.

      An isolated system implies a collection of matter which does not 
      interact with the rest of the universe at all - and as far as we know 
      there are really no such systems. There is no shield against gravity, 
      and the electromagnetic force is infinite in range. But in order to 
      focus on basic principles, it is useful to postulate such a system to 
      clarify the nature of physical laws. In particular, the conservation 
      laws can be presumed to be exact when referring to an isolated system:

      Perfectly elastic collisions are those in which no kinetic energy is 
      lost in the collision. Macroscopic collisions are generally inelastic 
      and do not conserve kinetic energy, though of course the total energy is 
      conserved as required by the general principle of conservation of 
      energy. The extreme inelastic collision is one in which the colliding 
      objects stick together after the collision.
