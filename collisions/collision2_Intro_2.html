      1. Before proceeding, you should ideally be familiar with the principles 
      related to collition, namely, principle of conservation of momentum for 
      al collisions. For elastic collisions, you will need to know about the 
      principle of conservation of kinetic energy and how this leads to the 
      equation relating the relative speed of approach and separation of the 
      collision bodies.

      2. For each simulation, try to predict the final speeds of the bodies 
      before playing the simulation for the case of elastic and inelastic 
      collisions.

      3. Relate the graphs of the velocities to the bodies before, during and 
      after the collision to your understanding of collisions. Recall that 
      momentum is conserved at all times before, during and after collision 
      and how that is represented in the graphs.

      4. Relate the graphs of the accelerations of the bodies during the 
      collision which is assumed to be constant for 0.05 sec. This is probably 
      unrealistic, why? Is 0.05 sec realistic in a collision? Relate the 
      acceleration to the force exerted by each body during the collision and 
      recall Newton's 3rd Law.
