	<p><i>Note:</i> When running this simulation on a tablet or smart-phone, set the parameters, then press the
			Play button. When running this simulation on a computer, be sure to check “No sensor,” then
			set the parameters and press the Play button. </p>
		<h1> Block On An Incline</h1>
		<p> The Block Sliding On An Incline Plane mobile JavaScript model illustrates the forces and
			dynamics of a block sliding on a surface. This simulation uses <b> the accelerometer on your
				mobile device</b> to read the direction of the gravitation field <i>g</i>. You may need to
			lock the orientation of your screen to maintain a fixed view as you tilt your device. For use
			on computers without an accelerometer or for classroom use, the "No sensor" mode simulates a
			tilted device in the view. </p>
		<p>A force body (free body) diagram showing the normal force (red), the gravitational force
			(black), and the force of friction (green) is shown. Users can set the initial position and
			velocity and can adjust both the static and kinetic coefficient of friction when the
			simulation is paused. Test your knowledge of incline plane dynamics by answering the following
			questions and comparing your answers with the simulation results. Remember to <b>press the
				play button</b> after you set the initial values.</p>
		<p>Initial values, such as x<sub>0</sub> and v<sub>0</sub>, can be set when the simulation is
			paused but not when the simulation is running. (Non-editable input fields have a grey
			background.) You may also drag the block when the simulation is paused.  The reset button
			returns the system to its default state while the reset time button returns the system to the
			previous values of x<sub>0</sub> and v<sub>0</sub>.</p>
		<h3> Physics Exercises:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Draw a force body diagram for a block on a horizontal surface (&#952; = 0°), labeling all
				forces.</li>
			<li>Draw a force body  diagram for a block on a surface inclined at an arbitrary nonzero angle of
				&#952;, labeling all forces.</li>
			<li>The formula for the force of friction <i>f</i> when the block is not slipping is often given
				in textbooks as <i>f</i> = &#956;<sub>s</sub><i>N</i> where <i>N</i> is the magnitude of the
				normal force. But the simulation shows that the force of friction changes as the surface
				tilts. Explain why the force of friction is not constant.</li>
			<li>What happens in the simulation if you set &#956;<sub>s</sub> less than &#956;<sub>k</sub>?
				Give a physical reason why the response is reasonable. What happens in the simulation if you
				set &#956;<sub>s</sub>  or &#956;<sub>k</sub> less than zero? Give a physical reason why the
				response is reasonable.</li>
			<li>Derive an expression for the maximum tilt angle without the block slipping (v<sub>x</sub>= 0)
				when &#956;<sub>s</sub>= {0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 5.0}. Verify with the simulation.  Note that
				the maximum allowed value of  &#956;<sub>s</sub>  is five in this simulation.</li>
			<li>The block is constrained to move from x = 1 (m) to x = 9 (m) by the end bumpers. Suppose ϴ =
				0°, and the block is given an initial speed, v = 3 m/s to the right. Derive an expression
				for how far the block will move. Verify with the simulation if the static coefficient of
				friction is &#956;<sub>s</sub>= 0.5 and the kinetic coefficient of friction is
					&#956;<sub>k</sub>= 0.4.</li>
			<li>Suppose &#952; = -30°, and the block starts from rest at x = 1 (m) with a speed of 3 (m/s) up the
				incline. Derive an expression for how far the block moves up the incline. Verify with the
				simulation if &#956;<sub>s</sub>= 0.6 and the kinetic coefficient of friction is
					&#956;<sub>k</sub>= 0.4.</li>
			<li>Suppose &#952; = +30°, and the block starts from rest at x = 1 (m) with a speed of 1 (m/s) down
				the incline.  Will the block stop before it reaches the end bumper if &#956;<sub>s</sub>=
				0.6 and the kinetic coefficient of friction is &#956;<sub>k</sub>= 0.4?  If not, what is the
				speed when the block reaches the bumper.  Derive an expression for the block to move at
				constant speed down the incline and verify with the simulation.  </li>
			<li>Suppose &#952; = +30°, and the block starts from rest at x = 1 (m) with a speed of 1 (m/s) down
				the incline.  Derive a value for &#956;<sub>k</sub> for the block to stop sliding just
				before it reaches the end bumper. Verify with the simulation. </li>
		</ol>
		<p><i>Note: </i> Because continuously reading the accelerometer may drain the battery on a
			mobile device, you must run the simulation to read the device tilt. The simulation will
			automatically pause after 4 minutes to conserve battery power.</p>
		<h3> Teaching and Learning Objectives:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Use the empirical law of friction between ordinary surfaces under both static and dynamic
				conditions. </li>
			<li>Solve free-body diagrams involving friction.</li>
			<li>Determine the physical limits of coefficients of kinetic and static friction.</li>
			<li>Use kinematic equations for constant acceleration to determine the motion of an object
				undergoing frictional forces.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>The Block Sliding On An Incline Plane mobile JavaScript model was developed by Wolfgang
			Christian using version 5 of the Easy Java Simulations (EJS 5) modeling tool. Although EJS is
			a Java program, EJS 5 creates stand alone JavaScript programs that run in almost any browser.
