      A projectile has a single force that acts upon it - the force of 
      gravity. If there were any other force acting upon an object, then that 
      object would not be a projectile. Thus, the free-body diagram of a 
      projectile would show a single force acting downwards and labeled force 
      of gravity (or simply F<sub>grav</sub>). Regardless of whether a 
      projectile is moving downwards, upwards, upwards and rightwards, or 
      downwards and leftwards, the free-body diagram of the projectile is 
      still as depicted in the diagram at the right.

      By definition, a projectile is any object upon which the only force is 
      gravity.

      Many students have difficulty with the concept that the only force 
      acting upon an upward moving projectile is gravity. Their conception of 
      motion prompts them to think that if an object is moving upward, then 
      there must be an upward force. And if an object is moving upward and 
      rightward, there must be both an upward and rightward force. Their 
      belief is that forces cause motion; and if there is an upward motion 
      then there must be an upward force.
