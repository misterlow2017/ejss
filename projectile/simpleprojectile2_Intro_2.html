      The following activities assume that you are already familiar with the 
      kinematics equations of motion and completed the linear motion of a body.

      <u>1.  Vertical and horizontal graphical plots</u>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0">
      For a particular setting of initial projection velocity and angle, 
      sketch the vertical velocity and horizontal velocity graphs, paying 
      attention to the axes values.  Likewise, sketch the vertical and 
      horizontal displacement graphs, again focussing on the axes and shape of 
      the graphs.  When you have completed the sketches, check against the 
      graphical plots after you played the simulation.

    <p style="margin-top: 0">
      For a particular setting of initial projection velocity and angle, 
      sketch the KE and PE with horizontal displacement.  Compare your 
      sketches with that produced by the simulation.

      <u>3.  Maximum height and range of the projectile</u>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0">
      For a particular setting, use the kinematics equations to predict the 
      maximum height and the range of the projectile. At this stage, ignore 
      the effect of air resistance.  Compare your values with those obtained 
      from the simulation.

      <u>4. Play the Hole-in-Wall game</u>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0">
      For a particular setting, check the &quot;Hole-in-Wall&quot; game to show a wall 
      with a hole on the screen.  Keeping either velocity or angle fixed, 
      predict and adjust the other variable to get the projectile to pass 
      through the hole.  This can be done by solving the kinematic equations 
      in the vertical and horizontal directions. Confirm by playing and seeing 
      the projectile pass through the hole.

      <u>5.  Effect of air resistance on the projectile</u>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 0">
      Select the air resistance checkbox, and observe the effect of air 
      resistance on the projectile motion. Specifically, observe the 
      difference in the trajectory, changes to the maximum height and maximum 
      range. Account for the differences in corresponding times to attain the 
      maximum height and duration of the timings in the maximum range in terms 
      of the changes to the acceleration in the vertical and horizontal 
      direction.
