      This activity assumes that you are already familiar with the kinematics 
      equations of motion.

      For a particular setting of initial projection velocity and angle, 
      acquaint yourself with the graphs of vertical and horizontal velocity, 
      followed by the vertical and horizontal displacements.  Relate the 
      potential and kinetic energies to the horizontal displacement of the 
      projectile.

      For a particular setting, use the kinematics equations to predict the 
      maximum height and the range of the projectile.  At this stage, ignore 
      the effect of air resistance.

      For a particular setting, check the &quot;Hole-in-Wall&quot; game and keeping 
      either velocity or angle fixed, predict and adjust the other variable 
      and adjust the value.  Confirm by playing and seeing the projectile pass 
      through the hole.

      Observe the effect of checking air resistance on the projectile motion.  
      Specifically, observe the difference in the trajectory, changes to the 
      maximum height and maximum range.  Account for the differences in 
      corresponding times to attain the maximum height and duration of the 
      timings in the maximum range.
