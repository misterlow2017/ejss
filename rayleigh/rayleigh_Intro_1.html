    <h4>
      The Rayleigh Criterion
    </h4>
    <p>
      The Rayleigh criterion is the generally accepted criterion for the 
      minimum resolvable detail - the imaging process is said to be 
      diffraction-limited when the first diffraction minimum of the image of 
      one source point coincides with the maximum of another.

    <p>
      For Single slit $$ \sin \theta_R = \frac {\lambda}{d} $$
    </p>
    <p>
      If all parts of an imaging system are considered to be perfect, then the 
      resolution of any imaging process will be limited by diffraction. 
      Considering the single slit expression above, then when the wavelength 
      is equal to the slit width, the angle for the first diffraction minimum 
      is 90&#194;&#176;. This means that the wave is spread all the way to the plane of 
      the slit and will not contain resolvable information about the source of 
      the wave. This leads to the simplified statement that the limit of 
      resolution of any imaging process is going to be on the order of the 
      wavelength of the wave used to image it.
