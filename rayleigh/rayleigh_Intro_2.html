    <h4>
      Case Study
    </h4>
    <p>
      Consider the rayleigh criterion to resolve the headlights of a car 
      approaching the eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      In dark or dim light, the pupil dilates to allow more light into the eye 
      to improve vision. Normal pupil size tends to range between 2.0 and 5.0 
      millimeters, depending on the lighting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dimensions of the eye are reasonably constant, varying among 
      individuals by only a millimetre or two; the sagittal (vertical) 
      diameter is about 24 millimetres (about one inch) and is usually less 
      than the transverse diameter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The separation between the headlights is 1 m.
