      As the skydiver falls, he encounters the force of air resistance. The 
      amount of air resistance \( f_{drag} \) is dependent upon two variables: 
      $$ f_{drag} = - \frac{1}{2} C \rho A v^2$$ where \( \rho \) is the air 
      density, A the cross sectional area and C is the drag coefficient. The 
      drag coefficient is 0.5 for a spherical object and can reach 2 for 
      irregularly shaped objects. <i>(Serway)</i>

      The speed of the skydiver
    </ul>
    <p>
      As a skydiver falls, he accelerates downwards, gaining speed with each 
      second. The increase in speed is accompanied by an increase in air 
      resistance (as observed in the animation below). This force of air 
      resistance counters the force of gravity. As the skydiver falls faster 
      and faster, the amount of air resistance increases more and more until 
      it approaches the magnitude of the force of gravity. Once the force of 
      air resistance is as large as the force of gravity, a balance of forces 
      is attained and the skydiver no longer accelerates. The skydiver is said 
      to have reached a terminal velocity. For a skydiver of mass 75 kg, and 
      an area of 0.7 \( m^2 \) the terminal velocity is about 60 \( m\ s^{-1} 
      \)

    <ul>
      The cross-sectional area of the skydiver
    </ul>
    <p>
      A skydiver in the spread eagle position encounters more air resistance 
      than a skydiver who assumes the tuck position or who falls feet (or 
      head) first. The greater cross-sectional area of askydiver in the spread 
      eagle position leads to a greater air resistance and a tendency to reach 
      a slower terminal velocity. The importance of cross-sectional area to 
      skydiving is also demonstrated by the use of a parachute. An open 
      parachute increases the cross-sectional area of the falling skydiver and 
      thus increases the amount of air resistance which he encounters (as 
      observed in the animation below). Once the parachute is opened, the air 
      resistance overwhelms the downward force of gravity. The net force and 
      the acceleration on the falling skydiver is upward. An upward net force 
      on a downward falling object would cause that object to slow down. The 
      skydiver thus slows down. As the speed decreases, the amount of air 
      resistance also decreases until once more the skydiver reaches a 
      terminal velocity.

      Trivia
    </ul>
    <p>
      Terminal velocity is often reported to be approximately 60 \( m\ s^{-1} 
      \) for a typical skydiver in free fall. Exceptional skydivers are able 
      to increase this value considerably by diving head first with their arms 
      against the sides of their bodies, legs held firmly together, and toes 
      pointed. This posture presents a minimal projected area perpendicular to 
      the direction of motion thus reducing aerodynamic drag. Special helmets 
      and slick body suits reduce drag even further.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a canopy opens the skydiver's rate of decent is dramatically 
      reduced, but the force applied also depends on the length of the 
      deceleration. If the canopy opens very fast, you will suffer a hard 
      opening. Proper packing of the parachute increase the length of the 
      opening thus reducing the opening shock significantly. The opening shock 
      can also be reduced by being in a stable horizontal body position prior 
      to canopy deployment.
